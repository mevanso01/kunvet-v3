                  For an opportunity-seeker, Kunvet provides her with the latest opportunities in the local community.

                  <p style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:1em; margin:0; line-height:180%;">We once were people searching for new opportunities, too. We were frustrated of seeing irrelevant, repetitive and insufficient amount of local opportunities on the internet. So, we decided to create a platform where people would not experience the frustrations we did.</p>
