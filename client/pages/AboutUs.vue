                    <h2>What is our Mission?</h2>
                    <p>We once were people searching for new opportunities, too. We were frustrated by seeing irrelevant, repetitive and insufficient amount of local opportunities on the internet. So, we decided to create a platform where people would not experience the frustrations we did.</p>
