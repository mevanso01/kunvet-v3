                    <h2>What is our Mission?</h2>
                    <p>In the job search process, we experienced first-hand the inefficiencies and flaws on various job sites. There was frustration in the number of irrelevant, repetitive, and out-of-date postings, and oftentimes a much too broad geographical filter. We created Kunvet to take these frustrations out of the job search process. Our mission is to provide applicants and employers alike with a seamless application process with highly-relevant, up-to-date, and local postings.</p>
