    <h1>Pricing</h1>
    <p>
      Each job posting is always $5 per post, whether its your first time posting or fifth time coming back. Each position stays posted for 30 days before being archived--our search results are always recent and up to date! Employers can expect about 6-16 applicants in that time, and we will gladly offer a refund if the job expires with fewer than 6 applicants. To repost or renew the posting, it's just another $5!

    <h2>Payment Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Kunvet accepts credit cards from major networks, and handles all transactions through a third-party PCI-DSS compliant payment processor. We do not store your credit card information or share any personal information. We value your privacy and trust.
