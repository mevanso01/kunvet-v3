            <p style="font-size: 1.3em;">Kunvet is designed for quicker hiring for smaller organization and personal hiring. Kunvet acts as a pre-screening process for your hiring.<br>
            Time is valuable to students and employers, so we ask employers to make up their decision within 35 days before actions are restricted to an application.
