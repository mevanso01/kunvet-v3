          <h2 class="article-sub-title" style="">What Makes an Excuse a Good One?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Good excuses, especially when they are lies, are short on
            details.</strong> Don’t trip yourself up. Keep it simple, and don’t
            feel pressured to reveal more details. Instead of elaborating,
            politely deflect any attempts by your boss or coworkers to sniff
            out any additional information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A good excuse also is a stand-alone event:</strong> it’s
            not going to require a bigger web of deceit or more explanations
            down the road.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bullet-content">
          <h2 class="article-sub-title" style="">5 Great Excuses for Missing Work</h2>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">1. Delivery of a Large Shipment</h3>
          <p>
            Once in awhile, you need to replace an old sofa, washing machine,
            or television, or get internet or cable services installed. If you
            don’t have a truck and a couple of beefcake buddies to rely on for
            muscle, you’re not going to be able to cart that item into your own
            home.
          </p>

          <p>
            You have to rely on delivery guys. It's understandable that
            you need to be off of work to receive the goods. It’s not always possible to schedule the arrival around your work
            hours, and sometimes the delivery company postpones or reschedules
            your delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use these occasions as a convincing and acceptable excuse
            to get out of work.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">2. Pet Appointment</h3>
          <p>
            This is a good, valid excuse for missing work on short notice, and
            it’s something that is completely out of your hands. Simply let
            your boss know you need the day off to take your pet to the vet.
            You don’t have to explain whether it’s for vaccines or other issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pets rely on us to take care of their medical needs, and vet
            appointments are usually packed. A scheduling conflict with the
            vet’s office is believable and acceptable, especially if your boss
            also has a pet.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, <strong>use appointment excuses carefully</strong>; your
            boss could respond that you can have a couple of hours off to go to
            the appointment, but they want you at work the rest of the day.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">3. Menstrual Cramps</h3>
          <p>
            There aren’t many upsides to menstrual cramps, but getting out of
            work makes it onto that very short list.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a <strong>classic excuse</strong>
            women have milked throughout the years because of its
            effectiveness. Everyone knows the reputation cramps have for
            messing with a woman’s body and moods.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a male boss, this excuse is especially golden, because
            you almost certainly won't be asked any additional questions about
            it. Men wisely treat the topic of menstrual cramps like the
            landmine situation that it is.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">4. Unexpected Circumstances</h3>
          <p>
            Emergencies happen—it’s a fact of life. Since everyone has had
            to deal with some sort of emergency at some point, this excuse is
            convincing and believable when handled correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make sure that your emergency is <strong>highly relatable</strong> and sounds like
            something that truly just came up and <strong>could happen to anyone</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">5. Not Feeling Well</h3>
          <p>
            It’s an overused excuse, but it works. We all feel under the
            weather sometimes, and questioning if someone is actually sick is
            like burping in public—it’s so impolite.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use this one, <strong>don’t go into details</strong>. You don’t need to paint
            the picture of having explosive diarrhea or frequent puking. Just
            state that you’re not feeling well—the flu, a fever, or migraine
            will do.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re calling in sick when you’re actually going to an
            event, don’t post those event pictures on social media. You’ll be surprised by the amount of employees who were caught faking sick because of social media. We’ll talk more about this in the <a>Pro Tips</a> section below.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bullet-content">
          <h2 class="article-sub-title" style="">What Makes an Excuse a Bad One?</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>A bad excuse is one that can be disproven.</strong> Your #1 goal should be
            to avoid getting caught. The only surefire way to do that is to
            stay home when you call in sick or use another excuse.
          </p>

          <p>
            You should also stay away from excuses that make you sound
            <strong>irresponsible, lazy, or stupid</strong>. Those won’t inspire confidence in
            you or the job you’re doing.
          </p>

        <div class="bullet-content">
          <h2 class="article-sub-title" style="">5 Bad Excuses to Avoid</h2>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">1. Vehicle Problems</h3>

          <p>
            With Ubers readily available, this excuse doesn’t pack the punch it
            once did. Unless you live in a rural area, this excuse won’t fly.
            Even then, you might have a well-meaning coworker offer to pick you
            up.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">2. Death of a Relative</h3>

          <p>
            The problem with death as an excuse is that it’s so permanent.
            While your life may feel like a soap opera sometimes, a resurrected
            parent is a storyline that won’t work. If you claim you’re missing
            work because your dad died when he’s perfectly healthy, that excuse
            will likely come back to haunt you. Plus, it’s just an awful thing
            to do.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">3. Feeling Tired</h3>

          <p>
            Here’s a news flash: everyone feels tired at some point, and they
            usually show up for work anyway. This excuse is so bad it’s one
            your boss may share with your coworkers behind your back. You don’t
            want to become the workplace joke. You’ll have to do better than
            that if you want a day off.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">4. Alarm Didn’t Work</h3>

          <p>
            The problem with this one is that it makes you sound wildly
            incompetent. You don’t want to sound like a college kid trying to
            pull one over on their professor when they’re asked why they missed
            class. This one is so trite, it’s as if you didn’t put any effort
            into an excuse at all.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">5. Unhappy with Job</h3>

          <p>
            Even if this excuse is true, never, ever admit it. That’s begging
            to be fired. If you call in and ask for a day off because you’re
            unhappy with your job, you might be fired on the spot. Unless
            that’s your intention, skip this excuse.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of living with a job that makes you want to dream up
            excuses so you can skip as many days as possible, why not put the
            effort into finding a better work situation instead? Your job isn’t
            a life sentence. You can <a href="https://kunvet.com/?utm_source=kunvet-blog&utm_medium=text-link&utm_campaign=5-great-excuses-for-missing-work" target="_blank">find a new one</a> that you enjoy going to
            each day.
          </p>

        <div class="bullet-content">
          <h2 class="article-sub-title" style="">8 Pro Tips</h2>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">1. Don’t Share Sick Day Events on Social Media</h3>

          <p>
            You shouldn’t post the truth of your absence on social media. Don’t
            put up posts like “Blowing off work today to watch Netflix” or take
            pictures of yourself at a ball game when your employer thinks
            you’re deathly ill.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Employers can use your social media profile information against
            you.</strong> If your boss sees it, you could be reviewed for misconduct.
            It will discredit your future sick excuses and impact the
            relationship between you and your employer.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Don’t share it with your co-worker, either. Even the best co-worker
            can get angry and reveal things to your boss that you thought were
            confidential.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">2. Keep Excuses Simple</h3>

          <p>
            When crafting an excuse, you want to be somewhat specific, but not
            overly so. You have to be able to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/extreme-fear/201005/top-ten-secrets-effective-liars?utm_source=kunvet-blog&utm_medium=text-link&utm_campaign=5-great-excuses-for-missing-work" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">remember the facts</a> you’ve already
            told about your lie.
          </p>

          <p>
            The more you explain about your situation, the more suspicious it
            will seem to employers that you are covering something up.
            Otherwise, why would you still be babbling on?
          </p>

          <p>
            If your over-explanations trip you up because your facts are no
            longer consistent, your employer may get angry or even fire you.
            Fakes excuses are grounds for dismissal. According to
            CareerBuilder, 26% of employers actually fire employees for fake
            excuses<sup><a href="#references" onclick="toggleReference(true);">[1]</a></sup>.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">3. Be Consistent</h3>

          <p>
            It’s very likely that your employer will follow up on your situation, so make sure that you’re consistent with your excuse.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">4. Notify Your Employer as Early as Possible</h3>

          <p>
            Your chances of missing work without raising suspicion will be much
            higher if you tell your employer as early as possible. It's
            courteous to give your employer enough time to readjust everyone’s
            shift and workload.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even if you’re really sick and unsure if you will make it to work or
            not, tell your employer that you might not be able to work. You
            don't want to spread germs. If you have the flu, it’s better to
            stay home and rehabilitate. If your work involves contacting
            customers directly, it’s even more important to rest at home.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">5. Notify Your Employer When You Will be Back to Work</h3>

          <p>
            If you don’t want anything to backfire, notify your employer when
            you’ll be back to work. This is professional and leads your
            employer to trust you more.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">6. Don’t Show Patterns</h3>

          <p>
            If you always <a href="https://www.insperity.com/blog/calling-in-sick?utm_source=kunvet-blog&utm_medium=text-link&utm_campaign=5-great-excuses-for-missing-work" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">call in or email your employer on a Friday</a>, it will
            rightly raise suspicion. If you take a sick day every month, that
            will, too.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">7. Understand Your Company’s Absence Policy</h3>

          <p>
            Read over the attendance policy and know your company's philosophy
            about taking time off. That will help you spot when you might need
            a doctor’s excuse or if you might face consequences for missing too
            much work. You'll also learn any guidance about who, how, or when
            to notify the company that you won't be at work. Following the
            rules shows respect.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-sub-sub-title" style="">8. Try to Be Honest </h3>

          <p>
            You might lie about taking off work because you feel like you’re
            letting down others who depend on you. You may fear being judged.
          </p>

          <p>
            But telling the truth, or at least a version of it, is always the
            best policy. It can strengthen your relationships with your boss
            and coworkers. If you’re entitled to a certain number of days as
            part of your company’s paid-time-off policy, then try to be honest
            with your employer. Tell them you would like to take some PTO and
            will come back better for it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bullet-content">
          <h2 class="article-sub-title" style="">Bottom Line</h2>

          <p>
            Everyone needs a little time off now and again. There’s no shame in
            that. Just be smart about the way you go about it. You’re not just
            earning a paycheck—you’re building a reputation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Protect that reputation by making smart choices and picking your
            excuses wisely.
